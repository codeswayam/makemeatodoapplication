# ToDo App

A simple, pure-frontend ToDo application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, and features a robust dark mode for improved user experience.

## Features

*   **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your ToDo list.
*   **Complete/Uncomplete Tasks:** Mark tasks as complete or uncomplete.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
*   **Data Persistence:** Your tasks are saved locally in your browser using `localStorage`, so they remain even after you close the tab or browser.
*   **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes. Your theme preference is also saved using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript

## How to Use

2.  **Add a Task:** Type your task into the input field and click the "Add Task" button or press Enter.
3.  **Complete a Task:** Click on the "Complete" button next to a task, or click on the task text itself, to mark it as done. Click again to uncomplete.
4.  **Delete a Task:** Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
5.  **Toggle Theme:** Click the "Toggle Dark Mode" (or "Toggle Light Mode") button in the top right corner to switch between themes. Your preference will be remembered.

## Deployment

This application is a static web application and can be easily deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages.

1.  Host the `index.html`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` files (along with any other static assets if they existed, though not in this case) on your web server or GitHub repository.
2.  Navigate to the URL where your `index.html` is hosted.

## Project Context

This project demonstrates a basic pure-frontend ToDo application, focusing on implementing a robust dark mode feature with state persistence using `localStorage`. It adheres to the constraints of a static web application with no backend or build tools, making it ideal for simple deployments like GitHub Pages.
